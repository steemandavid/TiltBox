## Build Instructions

### 1. 3D Printing

Print the enclosure parts in black PLA:

- [tilt_box.stl](hardware/tilt_box.stl) - Main enclosure body
- [tilt box grid.stl](hardware/tilt%20box%20grid.stl) - Grid overlay

### 2. Laser Cutting

Cut the following from the [wood and plexi.dxf](hardware/wood%20and%20plexi.dxf) file:

- **Walnut wood** (3.2mm thickness): Front frame
- **Clear acrylic/plexi**: Screen cover

### 3. Soldering

Solder the components according to the wiring diagram:

![Assembly](pictures/IMG_2046.jpeg)

### 4. Screen Assembly

The LED matrix needs a diffuser layer to blend the individual LEDs into a smooth display:

- **Diffuser**: Use a white plastic bag or similar translucent material between the LED matrix and the plexi cover
- **Optional darkening**: Adding a dark PVC film (e.g. available at Lukas Creative) provides additional darkness to the screen, improving contrast

### 5. Final Assembly

1. Insert the M3x5x7 threaded inserts into the 3D printed enclosure using a soldering iron
2. Mount all electronics inside the enclosure
3. Stack the layers: LED matrix -> diffuser -> (optional dark film) -> plexi -> walnut frame
4. Secure with M3x6mm screws (front) and M3x12mm screws (back)

## Games

Switch between games by flipping the board upside down.

### 1. Kitchen Timer
Set a countdown timer (1–99 minutes). Tilt left/right to adjust time, tilt forward to start. Shows remaining time on the display with a progress bar. Flashes red/yellow when time's up — tilt to dismiss.

### 2. Maze
Navigate a ball through a randomly generated maze. Tilt to move the yellow ball to the red goal. A rainbow animation plays when you win.

### 3. Snake
Classic snake game. Tilt to change direction and eat the red food to grow. Don't hit yourself!

### 4. Breakout
Break the colored bricks at the top with a bouncing ball. Tilt left/right to move the paddle.

### 5. Dodge
Avoid falling obstacles. Tilt left/right to move your player at the bottom. Score increases as obstacles pass.

### 6. Catch
Catch falling green items for points while avoiding red ones. Tilt left/right to move your basket. 3 lives — lose one for each red item caught.

### 7. Tetris
Classic falling block game. Tilt left/right to move pieces, tilt forward to rotate, tilt backward for fast drop.

### 8. Pong
1-player Pong against an AI opponent. Tilt left/right to move your paddle. Score increases with each volley. 3 misses and the game resets.

### 9. Balance
Keep a ball centered against random wind forces. The target zone shrinks over time, making it harder to stay alive. Pure tilt precision challenge.

### 10. Target Practice
Tilt a cursor to hit randomly appearing targets as fast as possible. 30-second timer. Tests raw tilt accuracy and speed.

### 11. Sokoban
Push-block puzzle game. Tilt to move your character and push blocks onto target positions. 8 levels of increasing difficulty.

### 12. Marble Race
Steer a marble along a scrolling track. Tilt left/right to stay on the path as speed increases. 3 lives — go off-track and you lose one.

### 13. Ball Trail
A simple ball that leaves a fading trail as it moves. Tilt to control direction.

### 14. Glow Ball
A glowing ball with a smooth gradient effect that follows your tilt movements.

### 15. Scroll Text
Displays scrolling text: "github.com/Tom-Michiels/TiltBox"

### 16. Animation
Cycles through animated patterns:
- Spiral rainbow
- Wave
- Rainbow gradient
- Fire effect
- Matrix rain
- Plasma
- Game of Life
- Fireworks

## Building and Flashing

Requires ESP-IDF v4.3+.

```bash
# Source ESP-IDF environment
source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

# Build
idf.py build

# Flash
idf.py flash

# Monitor serial output
idf.py monitor
```

## Controls

- **Tilt**: Move/control in all games
- **Flip board**: Switch to next game
- **Keep level during startup**: Calibrates the accelerometer

## Display Format

The WS2812 LEDs use GRB color format. Pixels are addressed row by row, 0-63.
